<h1>Alphabet 1</h1>
            <div class="tips-notes-panel">
                <p><em>We'll start with some simple sentences right away. Russian does not have articles, nor does it normally use the verb “to be” in the Present tense.</em></p>
                <h6>An em-dash is used instead of "the verb “to be” between the two nouns: «Мокка — кофе» ("A mocha is coffee").</h6>
                <p>Russian uses a version of the Cyrillic Alphabet. Many letters look similar to their Latin counterparts. As Cyrillic typography was remodeled around 300 years ago, both alphabets have a similar style.</p>

                <h3>Letters and Sounds</h3>
                <p><strong>К</strong>, <strong>О</strong>, <strong>М</strong>, <strong>Т</strong>, <strong>А</strong> sound similar to their Latin counterparts (to be more precise, "о" is the sound in "more"). However, in handwriting and typed italics, the letter <strong>Т</strong> can look rather like a lower case 'm' in the Latin alphabet. E.g. in the verb <em>просить</em> (to ask for, to request), <em>т</em> = t.</p>
                <p><strong>Е</strong> actually sounds more like "ye", as in "yell", not as in "Hear ye, hear ye!" (this will work for now; it's more complicated after a consonant).</p>
                <p><strong>В</strong> sounds like 'v', <strong>Б</strong> sounds like 'b'. <strong>Н</strong> is "n" and <strong>И</strong> is "i" ('eeh'). The remaining letters are included in the table below:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>⁰ <strong>Ёё</strong> The umlaut-like double dots are optional in writing. Syllables containing this letter are always stressed.</li>
                    <li>¹ <strong>т, д, н, л</strong> are pronounced near your teeth</li>
                    <li>² <strong>х</strong>('kh') is somewhat similar to the H in "hue". It is like making  the "sh" sound, only it is pronounced where you make the "K" sound.</li>
                    <li>³ <strong>ы</strong> has no equivalent in English. It is an "eeh"-like sound, but less distinct, sounds closer to "e" in "lover", and has your tongue deeper that in "heat" or "hit".</li>
                    <li>⁴ for <strong>ш</strong> and <strong>ж</strong> your tongue is lower than in English and slightly bent back. <strong>Щ</strong> has all your tongue raised—it is a longer and more hissy sound. <strong>Ч</strong> corresponds to <strong>щ</strong> (i.e. a bit different than "ch")</li>
                    <li>⁵ <strong>ъ</strong> and <strong>ь</strong> are separators and have no sound.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Л</strong> can have a flat top, like <strong>П</strong>, or a pointy top like <strong>А</strong> (it comes from the Greek Λ). Д and Л have a similar top in many fonts, though it's up to the designer. Handwritten <strong>Д</strong> looks like <em>D</em>, and <strong>д</strong> like a <em>g</em> or a <em>д</em> (the last two affect the italic shapes).</p>
                <p>An Italic <strong>Г</strong> in lower case usually looks this: <em>г</em>.</p>

                <p>P.S. In our notes, we use an accute accent to show you the stress (e.g., ра́дио). It is a standard practice in Russian textbooks for little children or foreign learners—and, generally, the most common way of marking the position of the stress.</p>
