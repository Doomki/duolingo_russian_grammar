<h1>The Accusative: the Direct Object</h1>
<h3>Accusative</h3>
<p>Until now, you've been using the base form of the word in sentence like «Он ест <strong>яблоко</strong>».</p>
<p>Actually, whenever a verb, like "read", "cut" or "want" acts <em>directly</em> on some noun, the latter is a <em>direct object</em>. Such nouns take the Accusative case.</p>
<h3>Formation</h3>
<p>Only feminine nouns ending in <strong>-а</strong> / <strong>-я</strong> have a separate form. «Мама» is a good example of this class :</p>
<ul>
<li>ма́ма → ма́м<strong>у</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Neuter nouns and feminine nouns with a final <strong>-ь</strong> (e.g., «мы́шь») use the Nominative form.</p>
<p>Now we are left with masculine nouns ending in a consonant (сок, медве́дь, брат). They use the same form as in Nominative or Genitive:</p>
<ul>
<li>living beings ("animate") copy the Genitive </li>
<li>objects  ("inanimate") stay Nominative</li>
<li>in plural this rule applies to all types of nouns</li>
</ul>

<p><em>With "substances"(mass nouns)</em> <strong><em>Genitive</em></strong> <em>may be used instead to convey a meaning of "some" quantity.</em></p>
<h6>Verbs that take a direct object are called <em>transitive</em>. Unfortunately, some verbs that are transitive in Russian are not transitive in English ("wait") and vice versa ("like").</h6>
<h3>I want some</h3>
<p>Russian has two main verb form patterns, which we are going to introduce soon. Unfortunately, the verb «хоте́ть»(to want) is irregular and mixes both. On a brighter note, it is a very common verb, so you'll memorize it eventually.</p>
<p>The other notable thing is that it does not have a strong connotation of 'need', unlike the English verb '"want". Similarly, the Russian verb for "give"(да́ть) is totally OK for polite requests. Just use it with «пожа́луйста».</p>
<ul>
<li><em>the one the 'giving' is directed towards is NOT a direct object in Russian. It is called an indirect object and takes the Dative. We'll deal with it later.</em></li>
</ul>
