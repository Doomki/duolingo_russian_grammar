<h1>The Infinitive, Likes and Dislikes</h1>
<h3>I like/I love ?</h3>
<p>In Russian, you can express liking things and activities pretty much the same way as in English, with similar verbs. The usage differs a bit, though.</p>
<p>A a rule of thumb, <strong>«Я люблю́»</strong> means <em>"I love"</em> only when directed at a single person (or animal). Otherwise, it's just "I like".</p>
<ul>
<li>"LOVE" <strong>люби́ть</strong> means a stable, lasting feeling (note the phonetic change for the 1st person singular: "люблю"). A normal, transitive verb, i.e. used with the Accusative. Use it for <strong><em>loving</em></strong> an individual or <em>liking some things/people/activity in general</em> (verbs take infinitive). Very much preferred in negations of such activities (i.e. "don't like to wait")</li>
<li>
<p>"LIKE" <strong>нра́виться</strong> means moderate "liking" something or someone, often something specific. Not transitive! The thing liked is the subject, acting indirectly on a person: «Мне нра́вится стол» = <em>I like the table.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>note that «Мне нра́вится стол» works in a similar way to the English verb "to seem": <em>"The table seems good to me"</em>. The sentence is built as though the table "transmits" the feeling towards you. While rare in English, in Russian, this is pretty typical for feelings and experience to be expressed that way («Мне хорошо́»). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h6>Infinitive «нра́виться» and 3rd person singular «нра́вится» are pronounced exactly the same, however, for the sake of consistency they are spelt differently (most infinitives end in «-ть», so -ть + ся = -ться, naturally)</h6>
<p>When you refer to generic things and activities, both verbs can be used but «люби́ть» is mildly more useful. </p>
<h3>May I?</h3>
<p>Possibility and/or permission are often expressed with words <strong>мо́жно</strong> and <strong>нельзя́</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>Здесь мо́жно жить. = One may live here.</li>
<li>Здесь нельзя́ есть. = One cannot/should not eat here.</li>
</ul>
<p>The English translation may vary. You can specify the person for whom the permission or recommendation applies, in the Dative (but you do not have to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Мне нельзя́ спать. = I should not sleep.</li>
<li>Нам нельзя́ мно́го есть. = We should not eat a lot.</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S.  the <strong>-ся</strong> at the end of "нра́вится" is a reflexive particle and comes after the ending (in verbs, use <em>-сь</em> after a vowel, <em>-ся</em> after a consonant) . Technically, a reflexive verb is one where the subject of the verb acts on itself. As you can see, often this is not always reflected clearly in the meaning. «Нра́виться» is one of those verbs that are reflexive "just because". </p>
<p>Don't worry about it too much for now, as we'll be tackling reflexives in more detail further down the tree.</p>
