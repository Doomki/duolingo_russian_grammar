<h3>Yummy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>«для»(for) always takes Genitive nouns</p>

<p>Food offers a delicious intake of mass nouns. Russian has them massed up even where English does not!</p>
<ul>
<li>so <strong>карто́шка</strong>(potatoes), <strong>лук</strong>(onions), <strong>шокола́д</strong> are mass nouns in Russian</li>
<li>and you may recall that mass nouns may be used in Gen. instead of Acc. if you mean "some quantity": <em>Купи́ сы́ра/карто́шки.</em> = Buy some cheese/potatoes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>'Taters</h3>
<p>The formal word for potato is <strong>карто́фель</strong> (German speakers, rejoice), but it's hardly ever used in speech. Use «карто́шка» instead.</p>
<p>The word for tomato is <strong>помидо́р</strong>. There is also the word <strong>тома́т</strong>, but it is</p>
<ul>
<li>the plant's name, pretty formal; look on pricetags</li>
<li>
<p>the base stem for derivative products: <em>тома́тная па́ста = tomato paste</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>посуда</strong> is a word for different containers used for cooking , consuming and further storage of food.  English, sadly, does not have the exact equivalent. However, it is obviously "dishes" that you wash and "cookware/tableware" that you buy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Verbal wisdom</h3>
<p>In this skill, we used <em>perfective</em> verbs for "cook", "cut", "wash". The reason is simple: that's the verb you'd use when you want a <em>single specific</em> action, often with a result—rather than referring to "activity" (activity may be fun but, in some cases, pointless).</p>
<p>More on that later. For now, just go with the flow.</p>
