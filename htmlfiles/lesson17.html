<h1>There is</h1>
<h3>Word order</h3>
<p>To say "there is/are" in Russian, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>say THE PLACE</li>
<li>then the verb (if any)</li>
<li>then THE OBJECT</li>
</ul>
<p>«есть» is not used, unless the sentence really has to emphasize the existence of the object.  Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>На столе́ ло́жка. = There is a spoon on the table.</li>
<li>На сту́ле ма́льчик. = There is a boy on the chair.</li>
<li>В до́ме никого́ нет. = There is no one in the house.</li>
<li>На столе́ лежи́т ко́шка. = A cat is lying on the table.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Present tense no verb is necessary; in the past, you would at least need a form of "to be". Note that even in the present Russian still uses verbs like "is situated", "stands", "lies" way more often than would be considered normal in English. </p>
<p>The most natural translation into English is a structure like "There is an apple on the table" or "An apple is on the table". The emphasis is on the object, not on the place.</p>
<p><em>Actually, such a sentence answers the question of WHAT is in the said place. For out-of-the-blue sentences about objects that have nothing unique about them it matches what English THERE-IS sentences are for. So this is what we have in this course.</em></p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p>The initial position of a "place" inside the sentence holds for many other structures, too. Whenever the place is not a part of the "message" of your sentence, it is usually somewhere at the beginning (that is, if the place frames your description of an action rather than providing crucial information).</p>
<p>If the whole point of uttering a sentence is telling someone about the place then, naturally, it takes the sentence-final position:</p>
<ul>
<li>За́втра я в Нью-Йо́рке. = I am in New York tomorrow. (not somewhere else)</li>
</ul>
<h3>lies/stands</h3>
<p>You don't have to translate verbs like "to stand" and "to lie" literally when they refer to objects. Such use is not, by a wide margin, nearly as standard in English as it is in Russian:</p>
<ul>
<li>На столе́ стои́т ча́шка. = <em>A cup is ("stands") on the table.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In English "to be" is perfectly fine, so we accept that.</p>
