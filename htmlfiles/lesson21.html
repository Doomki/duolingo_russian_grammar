<h1>Prepositions and Places</h1>
<h3>Verbs of motion</h3>
<p>Russian distinguishes between "going" on foot and by some sort of vehicle. If you aren't moving within the city, use a 'vehicle verb' <strong>ехать</strong> (one-way movement) or <strong>ездить</strong> (repeated, round trip or in general). More on that later, in "Motion verbs".</p>
<h3>Into/onto... at-to?</h3>
<p>Once again, with <strong>в</strong> and <strong>на</strong> you use Prepositional for <em>location</em>, and Accusative for <em>direction</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Я живу́ в <em>Ло́ндоне</em>. ~ I live in London.</li>
<li>Я е́ду в <em>Ло́ндон</em>. ~ I am going (by vehicle) to London.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a 'cheat sheet' of forms you'll need for places (no living beings, so—the easy Accusative for masculine):</p>

<h3>Word choice</h3>
<p>For "outdoors" Russians use <strong>«на улице»</strong> (literally, "on the street").</p>
<p>The preposition <strong>о</strong> (об) means "about" only as in the sense of "thinking/writing about". Don't use it for "approximately". With «<em>мне</em>» a special form is used, <strong>обо</strong>.</p>
<p>The contraction "USA" or "the U.S." is <strong>США</strong> (сэ-шэ-А, with the stress on the last vowel).</p>
<p>There is no difference drawn between "city" and "town".</p>
<p>In Russian it is typical to describe objects as "standing", "lying", "being situated", "hanging". This is rare in English, and often sounds unnatural, therefore in this course it is perfectly OK to translate a "whereabouts"-verb with a simple "is", "was" etc.</p>
<h3>Here and there, and here</h3>
<p>For "here", the words <strong>здесь</strong> and <strong>тут</strong> are almost completely interchangeable in any imaginable context. <strong>Тут</strong> is considered a bit more informal, and is used in set expressions ( тут же~right away, тут и там). «Здесь» is somewhat less suitable for figurative meanings (when by "here" you mean the current situation rather than a place). In this course, they are completely interchangeable when not being used in a set expression.</p>
<p><strong>находиться</strong> is a verb to denote the whereabouts of things, and, sometimes of people (when the emphasis is on exactly where they are). It could be translated as "to be situated" or "to be located", but as these verbs usually sound rather formal in English, so you can just use "to be".</p>
<p><strong>около</strong> is almost the same as «возле». It can also be used in the sense of "about"(=approximately).</p>
