<h1>Weather and Nature</h1>
<h3>It's raining</h3>
<p>"To go" is the verb used for precipitation in Russian:</p>
<ul>
<li>Идёт дождь = It is raining.</li>
<li>Идёт снег. = It is snowing.</li>
<li>Идёт град. = it is hailing <em>(we don't have it in the course)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>in summer/winter</h3>
<p>Russian has adverbs for "in spring", "in summer" etc. They are formed as the <em>Instrumental</em> case of a corresponding noun. </p>
<p>We'll cover Intrumental in detail later. Right now just get used to the words themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Весно́й мо́кро. = It's wet in spring</li>
<li>Зимо́й хорошо́ = It's good/nice in winter.</li>
<li>О́сенью гря́зно. = It's muddy in the fall.</li>
<li>Ле́том со́лнечно. = It is sunny in summer.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Russians usually assign each season 3 months, i.e. winter is December through February and spring is March through May (even if you have snow well into April).</h6>
<h3>Category of State</h3>
<p>It is easier than it sounds. When expressing a "state", some modality, or one's opinion on the situation, Russian often uses these <em>impersonal</em> words, saying that such and such state is observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Мне <strong>хо́лодно</strong>. = I'm (feeling) cold.</li>
<li>На у́лице <strong>тепло́</strong>. = It is warm outside.</li>
<li><strong>Хорошо́</strong>, что вы тут. = It is good you are here.</li>
<li><strong>Тру́дно</strong> сказа́ть. = It is hard to say.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many are homonymous with adverbs and short-form adjectives. So we'll study them later with adjectives. For now, we' only have a handful of such words useful when discussing the weather.</p>
<p>Needless to say, these do not use any grammatical subject and are quite useful with verbs like "to be" and "to become" ("It's getting warmer").</p>
<h6>The concept of "category of state" is not even taught to native speakers. However, it does have a distinctive pattern of use. Makes it easier to learn when you know why you say «мне хо́лодно».</h6>
