<h3>Give me that!</h3>
<p>By now, you have probably noticed a surprising lack of "that one" in Russian. The thing is, Russian mostly uses "этот" both for "this" and "that", unless you need to make a contrast between "this one here" and "that one there". </p>
<p>However, when you are really pointing at things, use whatever you like! </p>
<ul>
<li>«вот тут»~right here;«вот э́тот» ~ "this one here"</li>
<li>«вон там»~over there; «вон тот» ~ "that one over there"</li>
</ul>
<p>("вот" is acceptable with both)</p>
<h3>Clothing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>оде́жда</strong> is a mass noun for "clothes", <strong>о́бувь</strong> for footwear. </li>
<li><strong>ту́фли</strong> are also "shoes", but a more specific kind: "dress shoes" or the shoes you'd use with a gown</li>
<li><strong>боти́нок</strong> ...a dictionary will say it's a bit higher than a "dress shoe". In reality, especially in men's speech, the word is often used for shoes, too</li>
<li><strong>сапо́г</strong> is most definitely a boot</li>
<li><strong>пальто́</strong> is typically a long outer garment</li>
<li><strong>ку́ртка</strong> is more generic but usually refers to a shorter outer garment—with proportions not much different from a shirt</li>
<li><strong>руба́шка</strong> is the word used for shirt. «Соро́чка» is a formal word for a shirt that is worn as a part of a suit (eg. with pants, a jacket and a necktie), but people still use "руба́шка" anyway. </li>
</ul>
<h3>a bigger/smaller shirt</h3>
<p>From the <strong>Adjectives</strong> skill you might remember «бо́льше» and «меньше» as words for "more/bigger" and "less/fewer/smaller". Since these work as adverbs, it is problematic to use them with nouns. </p>
<p>Instead, the words <strong>«побо́льше» / «поме́ньше»</strong> are used AFTER a noun:</p>
<ul>
<li>Я хочу́ стол побо́льше/поме́ньше.</li>
<li>Да́йте я́блоко побо́льше.</li>
</ul>
<p>This works with some other popular adjectives: подлинне́е, покоро́че, полу́чше. When not used with nouns directly, these have a colloquial quality.</p>
<p>Actually, with adjectives other than <em>большо́й/мале́нький</em> you may resort to «бо́лее дли́нное пальто́». However, «бо́лее большо́е»? No. Just no.</p>
