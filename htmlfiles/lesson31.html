<h1>Dative and Plurals</h1>
<h3>The Dative Case in Russian</h3>
<p>You have already seen that many <strong>expressions of feelings and experience</strong> use the Dative: <em>”Мне нра́вится...”, “Ма́ме хорошо́”, “Ему́ 5 лет”, “Мне ка́жется ...”</em> etc. </p>
<p>The Dative introduces an <strong><em>indirect object</em></strong> of an action: usually the person whom the action is directed towards. An example would be a sentence like “I handed a package to <em>my mom</em>”: “my mom” here is a recipient. </p>
<p>Actually, this depends on the verb, just like in English. Some popular verbs of speech, writing or “giving” will use the bare Dative for the recipient: <strong><em>говори́ть, сказа́ть, писа́ть, чита́ть, дать, принести́</em></strong> and so on.</p>
<h3>Dative prepositions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>по</strong>: the basic meaning is “movement along the surface”("covering" it) which may realise as “walking around the park”, “running down the street”, “looking for it all over the house” etc. </li>
<li><strong>к</strong>: towards, to. Often used when you are going towards somebody (“towards Anna” = «к Анне»)</li>
<li>several bookish prepositional phrases like «благодаря́» (thanks to) or «вопреки́» (contrary to)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>По</strong> has an additional meaning, “apiece” or "each" : «Они́ взя́ли по три я́блока»=”They took 3 apples each”.</p>
<h6>There is a bookish use of «по» meaning "upon". It goes with Prepositional, and is mostly used in set prepositional phrases like «по оконча́нии» (upon completion).</h6>
<h3>Cases in plural</h3>
<p>Plurals generally have only <strong>one pattern</strong> shared by all nouns. The ending only depends on the case, not the class of a noun:, «я говорю́ о дома́х, стра́нах, города́х, я́блоках, дочеря́х».</p>
<p>Only the Nominative and (especially) the Genitive have a number of different plural endings that depend on the class of a noun.</p>
