<h3>Sequence of tenses in Russian</h3>
<p>There is no sequence of tenses in Russian whatsoever.</p>
<p>The information in a subordinate sentence is understood  to be relative to the main clause:</p>
<ul>
<li>Он сказа́л, что не зна́ет. = <em>He said he didn't know.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So if the piece of information is simply about where things are or what someone does, use present tense in the subordinate clause.</p>
<h3>ли</h3>
<p>Use the particle "ли" in reported questions or situations when you don't know which option is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Я спроси́л, зна́ет ли он Москву́. =<em> I asked him if he knew Moscow</em>.</li>
<li>Мы не зна́ем, бу́дет ли он в о́фисе. = <em>We don't know whether he is going to show up in the office</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h6>The particle is attached to the word that is in doubt. It needn't be a verb, for instance, «Я не зна́ю, в Москве́ ли он» (i.e. whether he is in Moscow or in some other city). The particle generally attaches to the first stressed word of the clause.</h6>
<h3>Talk or say?</h3>
<p>The verb <em>говори́ть</em> is used both as "to say, to tell" and as "to talk, to speak". When you report someone's words, obviously, the 2nd meaning is in action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Она говори́т, что хо́чет спать. = She says that she wants to sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>Russian has a whole set of <strong>perfective</strong> verbs. The thing is, usually you arrange verbs neatly into closely matching pairs of <em>imperfective + perfective</em>. And these are different for the two meanings of «говори́ть»:</p>
<ul>
<li>to say → говори́ть / сказ́ать</li>
<li>to speak → говори́ть / поговори́ть</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember «Скажи́те, пожа́луйста ... » ?</p>
<p>Rather than referring to ongoing actions or past(future) actions in general, perfective verbs refer to actions in a point-wise manner, ignoring the action's inner structure. That is, such "singular" actions happen at some particular "moment" and can be conveniently arranged in a sequence when telling a story.  This distinction is about to come into focus in one of the following skills.</p>
