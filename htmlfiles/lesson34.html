<h1>Instrumental Case</h1>
<h3>Fortunately, this is the very last case!</h3>
<p>It is used for some very specific meanings, that’s why we've put off covering it for so long.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is used alone for a “tool” or an “agent” of an action. English mostly uses “with” or “by” instead: “молотк<strong>ом</strong>” (with hammer), ”ветр<strong>ом</strong>” (by wind), “сил<strong>ой</strong>” (by force)</li>
<li>It is used alone with some verbs of “being”, “becoming”, “seeming”: <em>Я стал учител<strong>ем</strong></em> ~ “I have become a teacher”</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also used with prepositions:
- <strong>с (со)</strong> = “with” (together with someone/something) — note that with prepositions “Я с ней” or even “Мы с ней” is the most natural way of saying “She and I”
- <strong>за</strong>/ <strong>перед</strong> — behind/ in front of
- <strong>над</strong>/ <strong>под</strong> — above/under
- <strong>между</strong> — between (also used with Genitive)</p>
<h3>Мы с тобой</h3>
<p>When you tell someone about "you and I" or "my friend and I" etc., it is most idiomatic to use <strong>мы с</strong> + your companion in Instrumental. </p>
<ul>
<li>Мы с тобой друзья. = You and I are friends.</li>
<li>Мы с мамой вчера купили компьютер. = Mom and I bought a computer yesterday.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, when translating sentences out of the blue, you cannot (strictly speaking) tell if a speaker means "I" or "we". This is rarely a source of confusion in real situations (where it is unlikely a speaker goes on randomly switching between "I" and "we" ). </p>
<p>Sometimes you can interpret a joint action using "and" or "with", whatever sounds more natural:</p>
<ul>
<li>Мы с ними вчера не говорили. = They and I didn't talk yesterday / I didn't talk with (to) them yesterday.</li>
</ul>
<h3>But wait, there's more!</h3>
<p>Actually, Russian also has a handful of inconsistent cases that only exist for some words. They are (mostly) beyond the scope of this course:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>the Locative-2: the most important</em></strong> Why? Because it's obligatory with the nouns that it applies to. It expresses the meaning of place, with <em>в</em>,<em>на</em> or both. It exists for over a hundred masculine nouns: в год<strong>у</strong>, на мост<strong>у</strong>, в лес<strong>у</strong>, на пол<strong>у</strong>. And for about 20 feminine nouns in —<strong>ь</strong>: в кров<strong>и</strong> (the ending is always stressed for both!)</li>
<li><strong><em>the Neo-vocative:</em></strong> a form of a name used when addressing a person. It exists for common names and several nouns: <strong><em>Вань! Вер! Алён! Мам! Пап!</em></strong> (just the last vowel sound is removed). The Historical vocative  ("человек → человече") has been lost in modern Russian.</li>
<li><strong><em>the Genitive-2</em></strong>　for “some amount of substance”. Increasingly replaced by the usual Genitive but still can be used for several masculine nouns: “Хочу ча<strong>ю</strong>”</li>
<li><strong><em>“Waiting” case:</em></strong> not much of a case, but actually the verb “ждать” (to wait) would use Accusative for people and things that can affect their appearance and Genitive for everything else (an event/thing that does not  choose when to arrive).</li>
</ul>
