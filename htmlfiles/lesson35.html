<h1>Body, Life and Death</h1>
<h3>You have big eyes</h3>
<p>Be careful NOT to use «есть» when describing properties of body parts, if their existence is normal and unlikely to surprise anyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>У меня длинный нос = <em>I have a long nose</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Handy thing to know</h3>
<p>The Russian words for limbs and what they have on the end of them can be a little confusing initially. Depending on the situation, рука can mean hand or it can mean arm. The same is true for нога; it can be foot or leg. Most of the time the meaning is clear from the context.</p>
<p>The difference works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>in English "hand", strictly speaking, means the part starting at the wrist.</li>
<li>in Russian «рука», strictly speaking, means the whole arm.</li>
<li>when you need a word describing the limb <em>functionally</em> (as something we use to work, to grab things etc.), English uses "hand" while Russian uses "arm"</li>
</ul>
<p>The same goes for the lower limb.</p>
