<h1>Name and polite "You"</h1>
<div class="tips-notes-panel"><h3>Thou art</h3>
<p>Russian makes a distinction between <strong>ты</strong>, singular "you", and <strong>вы</strong>, plural "you" (y'all). The latter also doubles for "polite" you, with verbs also in plural. And don't forget that the "excuse" in "Excuse me" is a verb! </p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>ты</strong> with friends and your family members</li>
<li>Use <strong>вы</strong> with adult strangers, your teachers and in other formal interactions (at the store, the doctor's, the airport etc.)</li>
<li>People use <strong>вы</strong> with those who are much older </li>
<li>Nobody is "polite" toward kids</li>
</ul>
<h6>Contrary to what many native speakers have come to believe in the last ten or fifteen years, the polite "you" is not automatically capitalized in Russian, and never was. Such capitalization is used in some formal styles.</h6>
<h3>Grandson, son of Grand</h3>
<p>As you might know if you ever read any Russian literature, Russians have three names; their first name and their surname—just like you have—and a <em>patronymic</em> (отчество), which is based on their father's name (отец = father). A very common 'polite' pattern is to use a person's first name and a patronymic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ива́н Иванович, вы за́няты? = <em>Ivan Ivanovich, are you busy?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, <strong>name+patronymic</strong> are always used with the polite <strong>вы</strong>-form.</p>
<h3>What is your name?</h3>
<p>«Как вас зову́т?» is literally "How (do) they call you?"</p>
<p>Russian has a casual diminutive form for many common names, : Ива̓н→Ва́ня, Мари́я→Маша, Алекса́ндр(Алекса́ндра)→Са́ша, Евге́ний(Евге́ния)→Же́ня, Еле́на→Ле́на, Алексе́й→Лёша, Пётр→Пе́тя. Needless to say, there's no "politeness" with these, but they are often used with some degree of affection.</p>
<h3>Excuse me...</h3>
<p>Russian has two very common polite patterns for questions that English does not:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>negative</strong> questions give a shade of "by any chance": «Извини́те, вы не зна́ете Михаи́ла?» = <em>Excuse me, do you happen to know Mikhail?</em></li>
<li><strong>"Please tell"</strong> when asking for information: «Скажи́те, пожа́луйста, где музе́й?» = <em>Excuse me, where is the museum?</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Thank you</h3>
<p>«Спаси́бо»  is the word. A fancier option would be «Благодарю́!» (a form of the verb «благодари́ть», "to thank"), though quite a number of people use it, if only for variety.</p>
