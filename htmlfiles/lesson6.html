<h1>Where is it?</h1>
<div class="tips-notes-panel"><p>Russian words take different forms depending on their role in the sentence. These forms are called <strong>cases</strong>. A few forms may look the same (cf. "frequent rains" vs. "It rains often").</p>
<p>These forms have names (mostly calques from Latin) that describe some "prototypal" use of such case: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Prepositional, Dative and Instrumental. For you, these are just tags: the use is what defines a case.</p>
<p>As of now, you know the NOMINATIVE case: the dictionary form of a word. This form acts as the <em>grammatical subject</em> of the sentence, the "doer". It is also used for both nouns in "A is B" structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Мой па́па ест.</li>
<li>Том — мой брат.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also know a few Genitive forms (у <strong>меня</strong>) but that's it. For now, we will tackle something easier.</p>
<h3>Prepositional case</h3>
<p>When we talk about things <strong><em>being</em></strong> somewhere, we typically use <strong>в</strong>(in) or <strong>на</strong> (on) with the Prepositional form of the noun. It doesn't work when you mean  <em>motion</em> to that place! </p>
<p>The Prepositional case (a.k.a. Locative) is the only case that is <em>never</em> used on its own without a preposition, even though only four or five prepositions ever use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Я на конце́рте. = I am at a concert.</li>
<li>Я в шко́ле. = I am at (in) school.</li>
<li>ви́део о шко́ле = a video about school</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike English (“at/in school”), in Russian each "place" is associated with just one preposition. The rough overall rule is: use “в”(in, at) when talking about buildings and places with certain boundaries and use “на” (on, at) when talking about open spaces or events:</p>
<ul>
<li>в до́ме <em>(at home)</em>, в шко́ле <em>(at school)</em>, в ко́мнате <em>(in the room)</em>, в теа́тре <em>(in the theater)</em>, в кино́ <em>(at the cinema)</em>, в университе́те <em>(at the university)</em></li>
<li>на ули́це <em>(in the street, outdoors)</em>, на пло́щади <em>(at the square)</em>, на конце́рте <em>(at the concert)</em>, на уро́ке <em>(at the lesson)</em>, на кора́бле <em>(on a ship)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When you mean physically being inside/on top of some object, there is little ambiguity. "Places", unfortunately, require memorization.</p>
<h3>Prepositional endings</h3>
<p>Here is the rule that covers most nouns:</p>
<ul>
<li>feminine nouns ending in ь take <strong>-и</strong></li>
<li>nouns ending in -ия, -ий or -ие also take <strong>-и</strong> (so that they end in -ии instead)</li>
<li>all other nouns take <strong>-е</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>What about me and my friends?</h3>
<p>Use “у + Genitive” when talking about being at some <em>person’s</em> place: Да, я у дру́га = <em>Yeah, I am at my friend’s place</em>.</p>
<h3>▲▼WC</h3>
<p>The room with a toilet is <strong>туале́т</strong>. In this course, we stick to the North American "bathroom", even though a room with a bath is, technically ва́нная (it has ва́нна, "a bath"). Still, in Russian you would not ask for a "bath-room" unless you really mean it.</p>
<h3>And what if I gotta go <strong>away</strong>?</h3>
<p>We’ll deal with that later. But the pattern is consistent. When you <strong><em>are</em></strong> somewhere, going <strong><em>to</em></strong> that place and going <strong><em>away</em></strong> from that place, use the following triplets:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">AT</th>
<th align="center">TO</th>
<th align="center">FROM</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>в</strong> + Prep</td>
<td align="center"><strong>в</strong>  + Acc</td>
<td align="center"><strong>из</strong> + Gen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>на</strong> + Prep</td>
<td align="center"><strong>на</strong> + Acc</td>
<td align="center"><strong>с</strong> + Gen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>у</strong> + Gen</td>
<td align="center"><strong>к</strong> + Dat</td>
<td align="center"><strong>от</strong> + Gen</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, if the place is used with на, the correct prepositions for the three uses are на–на–с.</p></div>
