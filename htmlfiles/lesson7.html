<div class="tips-notes-panel"><h3>"Spelling rules"</h3>
<p>Note how plurals of «соба́ка» and «ко́шка» end in И: соба́ки, ко́шки, even though you might expect А to turn into Ы.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on which consonants are used with which vowels when making word forms. Here are the rules for <strong>и, а, у</strong> vs. <strong>ы, я, ю</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>use only И, not Ы, after <strong>к, г, х</strong>/ <strong>ж, ш, щ, ч</strong> </li>
<li>use only А, У after <strong>к, г, х</strong>/ <strong>ж, ш, щ, ч</strong> and <strong>ц</strong> (and never use Я, Ю after them)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>К, Г, Х</em> are called velar consonants (i.e. made in the back) and <em>Ш, Щ, Ж, Ч</em> are often called <em>hushes</em>. The latter do not show palatalized/non-palatalized pairs in modern Russian, so the spelling rule does not affect pronunciation anyhow. It's just a convention.</p>
<h3>Fleeting vowels</h3>
<p>It is not too important for you at the moment, but you may notice how О and Е sometimes appear in consonant clusters or disappear from them. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Э́то лев. = This is a lion.</li>
<li>В зоопа́рке нет льва́. = There isn't a lion at the zoo.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Later you will encounter the Genitive plural (often used with numbers and words like "many" or "few"), which shows a simple pattern for <strong>-к</strong>-suffixed feminine nouns that do not have a vowel before "-ка":</em></p>
<ul>
<li>много кошек = <em>many cats</em></li>
<li>много девочек = <em>many girls</em></li>
<li>много уток = <em>many ducks</em></li>
<li>много тарелок = <em>many plates</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>As you can see, the vowel (О or Е) depends on whether the previous consonant is palatalized or not. Hushes behave as if they were palatalzed, despite Ж and Ш having lost this quality in the modern language.</em></p></div>
